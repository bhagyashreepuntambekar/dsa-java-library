# DSA Java Library

A personal library of **custom data structures and algorithms** implemented in **Java** for learning, practice, and portfolio purposes.

This library includes implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, and sorting algorithms, along with **test classes** to verify correctness.

## Features

- **Arrays**: Dynamic array with resizing  
- **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists  
- **Stacks & Queues**: Array-based and linked-list-based  
- **Hash Tables**: Separate chaining implementation  
- **Trees**: Binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree (optional)  
- **Heaps**: MinHeap and MaxHeap  
- **Sorting Algorithms**: QuickSort, MergeSort, RadixSort  
- **Graph Algorithms (Optional)**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra  
- **Tests**: Each structure includes a test class with example usage
